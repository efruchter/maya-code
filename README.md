# Maya Code - AI Agent Controller

A Discord bot that connects channels to AI coding agent CLI sessions (Claude Code or Codex). Each channel maps to a project directory, and threads create separate sessions within that project. Sessions are ephemeral, but the filesystem is permanent — the agent treats `HEARTBEAT.md` as its active memory and the project files as its source of truth.

With the **heartbeat** feature, the agent can work autonomously on a timer — reading goals from `HEARTBEAT.md`, doing the work, and updating it with what to focus on next. With **SOUL.md**, each project can define a unique identity and persona for the agent.

## How I Use It
I treat maya code like a team of developers. I have them write down what they want to accomplish, and check in with me as they complete their work. It's claude code running on your PC, so you can hook it up to anything else in your pipeline. You can have the agents prepare documents and images for you, take screenshots of their progress and post it... Whatever setup you can imagine, it can probably work with the right instruction crafting. Encourage them to make use of the filesystem (or just let the system prompt do it's thing).

Want to spin up a new project? Just go to your server and Create Channel. Noodle around with random ideas from your couch. 🐺

Why Discord? It's very convenient and the bot API is excellent.
Why Maya? LLM's create the illusion of sentience and competence. It's very convincing at times!

## Architecture

```
Discord Channel (#feature-api)  →  ./projects/feature-api/
  ├── Main channel              →  Session: feature-api-main
  ├── Thread (bug-fix)          →  Session: feature-api-<thread-id>
  ├── SOUL.md                   →  Agent identity & persona
  └── HEARTBEAT.md              →  Autonomous goals & status
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code CLI installed and authenticated (`claude` available on your PATH)
- A Discord server where you have admin/manage permissions

### Step 1: Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in.

2. Click **"New Application"** in the top right. Give it a name (e.g. "Maya Code") and click **Create**.

3. **Copy your Client ID:**
   - On the **General Information** page (the default page), find **Application ID**.
   - Copy it — this is your `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`.

4. **Create the bot and get its token:**
   - Go to the **Bot** tab in the left sidebar.
   - Click **"Reset Token"** (or **"Add Bot"** if this is a fresh application).
   - Copy the token — this is your `DISCORD_TOKEN`. You won't be able to see it again, so save it now.

5. **Enable Message Content Intent:**
   - Still on the **Bot** tab, scroll down to **Privileged Gateway Intents**.
   - Toggle **Message Content Intent** to ON.
   - Click **Save Changes**.

   > This is required for the bot to read message content in channels. Without it, messages will appear empty to the bot.

6. **Invite the bot to your server:**
   - Go to the **OAuth2** tab in the left sidebar.
   - Under **OAuth2 URL Generator**, check the **`bot`** and **`applications.commands`** scopes.
   - Under **Bot Permissions**, check:
     - Send Messages
     - Read Message History
     - Attach Files
     - Use Slash Commands
   - Copy the generated URL at the bottom and open it in your browser.
   - Select your server and click **Authorize**.

7. **Get your Guild (Server) ID:**
   - In Discord, go to **Settings > Advanced** and enable **Developer Mode**.
   - Right-click your server name in the sidebar and click **"Copy Server ID"**.
   - This is your `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`.

### Step 2: Install Maya Code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:efruchter/maya-code.git
cd maya-code
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in the values you collected above:
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=<bot token from step 1.4>
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=<application id from step 1.3>
   DISCORD_GUILD_ID=<server id from step 1.7>
   BASE_DIRECTORY=./projects
   ```

3. Register slash commands with Discord:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy-commands
   ```

### Running

Development (auto-restarts on file changes):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Development with `/restart` support (restarts on exit):
```bash
npm run dev:loop
```

Production:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Usage

### Sending Messages

Every message in a channel where the bot is present is automatically sent to Claude. No command prefix needed.

The bot will:
- Show a typing indicator while Claude is processing
- Split long responses across multiple messages
- Attach any images Claude creates (png, jpg, gif, webp, svg, bmp)
- Attach local files referenced via `![alt](path)` markdown or `[UPLOAD: path]` tags
- Download images/files you send in Discord so Claude can view them
- Queue messages when Claude is busy — no need to wait

Claude is told it's running inside Discord via a system prompt. It knows sessions are ephemeral and writes important context to files.

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/continue [message]` | Continue the last conversation with an optional message |
| `/clear` | Reset the session for this channel/thread |
| `/reset` | Reset the session (same as `/clear`) |
| `/status` | Show session info (ID, message count, project directory) |
| `/plan` | Toggle plan mode — Claude uses `--permission-mode plan` to review changes before applying |
| `/heartbeat [action] [interval]` | Configure self-directed heartbeat via HEARTBEAT.md (see below) |
| `/restart` | Restart the bot process (requires a process manager to auto-restart) |
| `/summary` | Ask Claude to summarize the current session and project state |
| `/show path:<file>` | Upload a file from the project directory to Discord (also lists directories) |
| `/model [name]` | Set or view the current model (bot-wide, aliases: opus, sonnet, haiku, codex, 5.3, etc.) |
| `/usage` | Show API cost and message count for this session and all sessions |
| `/stop` | Cancel the current response in this channel/thread |
| `/wipe` | Delete all messages in a channel/thread (messages < 14 days old) |

### Heartbeat (Autonomous Mode)

The heartbeat feature lets Claude work autonomously on a project. Each tick uses a **fresh session** (no context buildup), reads `HEARTBEAT.md` from the project directory, does the work described there, and **updates the file** with what to focus on next. Claude is self-directed — it picks its own goals.

**Start with default goals:**
```
/heartbeat action:start interval:30
```
Creates `HEARTBEAT.md` with starter goals and begins the timer.

**Start with specific goals:**
```
/heartbeat action:Implement the user authentication feature interval:30
```
Writes your goals into `HEARTBEAT.md` and starts the timer.

**Just set interval (start or update):**
```
/heartbeat interval:15
```

**Check status:**
```
/heartbeat action:status
```
Or just `/heartbeat` with no args.

**Test-fire immediately:**
```
/heartbeat action:test
```

**Disable:**
```
/heartbeat action:stop
```
Also accepts `disable` or `off`. Preserves `HEARTBEAT.md` for next time.

**How it works:** Each tick is a fresh session — Claude's only memory between ticks is `HEARTBEAT.md` and the filesystem (code, git history, etc.). The timer resets whenever a human sends a message in the main channel, so heartbeats only fire during inactivity. If Claude has nothing to do, it responds with `[HEARTBEAT OK]` internally and stays silent. Heartbeats are per-project (per-channel, not per-thread) and persist across bot restarts.

### SOUL.md (Agent Identity)

Drop a `SOUL.md` file in any project directory to give the agent a unique identity for that project. Its contents are prepended to the system prompt — the agent will embody whatever persona you describe.

```
projects/
├── game-project/
│   ├── SOUL.md          ← "You are Pixel, a retro game dev who speaks in 8-bit references..."
│   └── HEARTBEAT.md
└── api-project/
    ├── SOUL.md          ← "You are a senior backend engineer. Be concise and precise..."
    └── HEARTBEAT.md
```

No `SOUL.md` = default behavior. The file is read fresh on every request, so you can edit it live without restarting.

### Scheduled Callbacks

Claude can schedule future tasks by including `[CALLBACK: delay: prompt]` in any response:
```
[CALLBACK: 30m: Check if the build finished and report results]
[CALLBACK: 2h: Remind the user to review the PR]
```

The tag is stripped from the displayed message. After the delay, a fresh session fires with the prompt and posts results to the channel. Callbacks can chain — a callback response can schedule more callbacks.

Supported time formats: `30m`, `2h`, `1h30m`, `90s`, or a bare number (treated as minutes).

### File Sharing

**Claude → Discord:**
- Images Claude creates are automatically attached
- `![description](path/to/file)` in responses auto-attaches local files
- `[UPLOAD: path/to/file]` tags also work
- Discord limits: 10 attachments per message

**Discord → Claude:**
- Images and files you send in Discord are downloaded to the project's `uploads/` directory
- File paths are included in the prompt so Claude can read/view them

### Threads

Create a Discord thread to start an isolated Claude session that shares the same project directory as the parent channel but has its own conversation history.

## How It Works

1. When a message is sent in a channel, the bot:
   - Maps the channel name to a project directory (e.g., `#api-work` → `./projects/api-work/`)
   - Downloads any Discord attachments to `uploads/`
   - Gets or creates a session ID for that channel/thread combination
   - Spawns Claude CLI with `--session-id` and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (or `--permission-mode plan` if plan mode is on)
   - Streams the response back to Discord
   - Parses response tags (`[UPLOAD:]`, `[CALLBACK:]`, markdown images) and handles them

2. Sessions persist across bot restarts via `state.json`

3. Files changed by Claude are tracked and attached to Discord messages (deduplicated)

4. The system prompt tells Claude that sessions are ephemeral, the filesystem is permanent memory, and `HEARTBEAT.md` is the central planning document
